## Introduction

This website is a project for Code Institute's January 2022 Hackathon, hosted in collaboration with digital recruitment firm SODA and their networking event SODA Social. The theme of the Hackathon was mindfulness and wellbeing in the workplace. 

The website was created by Naoise Gaffney, Marina Pavlovic, Goran Kuzma, Eva Kuk and Adam Boley, with the project facilitated by Aisha Bushell

The aim of the project is to help digital workers - those working in offices and those working from home - maintain their wellbeing and mindfulness whilst working. When working in an office, workers are often sitting down for long periods, and may not have particularly ergonomic workstations. Those working from home face these issues as well, and more besides - when working from home, it is all too easy for work time to spill over into personal time, with workers constantly in "work-mode", and unable to switch off from work. 

Thus, the website's main features are several timers that are activated at the start of the day. Each timer counts down from a fixed value, and when it expires, it flashes up a message and plays a soft audio tune to alert the user. The message reminds the user to do one of several tasks - drink some water, do some breathing exercises, do some stretching, eat lunch, go for a walk and finally stop work. The idea is to break up the user's day and try to prevent burnout by giving their brain a break. The message to stop work should stop users from working more than their hours and protect their personal time, allowing them to relax and rest

# Technologies

[Github](https://github.com/): Adam Boley's Github was used to host the main project files and folders. Other team members then forked to their repositories. 

[Gitpod](https://gitpod.com/): Most team members used the Gitpod IDE to create and edit the project files. Other team members preferred Visual Studio Code.

[Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/): Flask was used to create a framework for the project.

[Flask User](https://flask-user.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): Flask User was used to create the registration and login functionality

[Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/): Slack was used to communicate and coordinate the actions of team members, share screenshots, and join video calls to discuss the project

[Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/): Google Docs was used to create and edit a shared document to note down ideas.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.
